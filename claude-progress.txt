## Previous Session (2026-01-15 - Data Persistence Fix)

### ✅ Andres Nieto Summary & Data Persistence - COMPLETE!

**Task:** Fix Andres Nieto's case summary to correctly display "Claim finalized, job at IKON" and ensure data persists through Freshdesk syncs.

**Critical Bug Fixed:**
- **Issue:** Freshdesk sync was overwriting manually-set `summary` and `workStatus` fields
- **Impact:** Andres's summary kept reverting to old ticket subject, work status kept showing "Off work"
- **User Impact:** Days of frustration trying to display correct case information

**Solution Applied (server/storage.ts):**
```typescript
// Preserve existing summary if it contains meaningful content
const shouldPreserveSummary = existing.summary &&
  existing.summary.length > 0 &&
  !existing.summary.startsWith('Symmetry-');

// Preserve work status if manually set to "At work"
const shouldPreserveWorkStatus = existing.workStatus === 'At work';
```

**Database Updates for Andres Nieto (FD-43714):**
- `workStatus`: "At work" ✅
- `summary`: "Claim FINALISED. Full-time cleaner at IKON Services since 08/12/2025..." ✅
- `aiSummary`: Full detailed markdown with Medical Status, Key Items, Risk Factors, Next Actions ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `server/storage.ts` - Added preservation logic for summary and workStatus during sync
- Created `update-andres-summary.ts` (temporary script, executed and deleted)

### ✅ PDF Task Plan for Natalie - COMPLETE!

**Created:** `Natalie-Task-Plan-15-Jan-2026.pdf`

**Tasks Included (9 total):**
1. Verify Andres Nieto fix
2. Test dashboard filters (Workers at work, Workers off work)
3. Audit medical certificates in Freshdesk
4. Verify work status accuracy across all cases
5. Add discussion notes to key cases
6. Update contact information
7. Review injury details
8. Test compliance action navigation
9. Test Freshdesk sync (manual data preservation)

### 🐛 PENDING BUG - Certificate Date Issue

**Bug Report:** Timeline tab for Andres Nieto shows incorrect certificate date

**Database Query Result:**
```
Certificates for Andres:
Start: 2026-06-30T16:00:00.000Z End: 2026-06-30T16:00:00.000Z Capacity: partial
```

**Issue:** Date is in the future (June 2026) - clearly incorrect data that needs investigation.

**Next Steps:**
1. Investigate source of incorrect date (Freshdesk import? Manual entry?)
2. Check certificate parsing logic
3. Update certificate with correct dates

---

## Future Features Discussed

### Weekly Report Feature
- Dashboard will show weekly report with three columns:
  - **Who:** Person responsible for next action
  - **What:** Description of action needed
  - **When:** Due date
- Recipients: Employer, treating doctor, insurer, worker
- Use case: Track appointments, treatment plans, deadlines

### Pre/Post Appointment Workflow
- Track questions to ask before appointments

## Previous Session (2026-01-15 - Case Summary & Recovery Graph Fixes)

### ✅ Critical Data Corruption Fix - COMPLETE!

**Issue Resolved:** All worker cases were showing identical "Andres Nieto/IKON Services" summary content instead of individual case details.

**Root Cause:** Mock data flag hardcoded to `true` in `server/services/summary.ts:269` was bypassing real AI generation.

**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Fixed in server/services/summary.ts:269
const useMockData = false; // Set to false when API key is working
```

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Giorgio Aparicio (FD-45151) now displays unique case-specific content
- ✅ Company shows "Symmetry" (not IKON Services)
- ✅ Injury details show trigger finger (not back strain)
- ✅ Case timeline shows Giorgio's actual medical history from March 2025-January 2026
- ✅ Financial details show Giorgio's actual wages ($1,211.62/week)
- ✅ Contact details show Giorgio's actual employer contacts, medical providers

### ✅ Recovery Graph Visualization Fix - COMPLETE!

**Issue Resolved:** Green actual recovery line was starting after blue estimated recovery line, causing visual misalignment.

**Root Cause:** `generateActualCurve()` in `server/services/recoveryEstimator.ts` started from first certificate week instead of week 0.

**Solution Applied:**
```typescript
// Modified loop in generateActualCurve()
for (let week = 0; week <= lastCertWeek; week++) {
  // Allow null actualCapacity before first certificate
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `server/services/recoveryEstimator.ts` (lines 1390-1414)
- `server/services/recoveryEstimator.test.ts` (updated test expectations)

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ Both estimated and actual recovery lines now start from week 0
- ✅ Visual alignment is correct in Treatment tab recovery graph
- ✅ All tests continue to pass (165/165)

### ✅ System Health Verification - COMPLETE!

**Test Results:** 165/165 tests passing ✅
**Application Status:** Both backend (port 5000) and frontend (port 5173) running properly ✅
**Browser Testing:** Giorgio Aparicio case fully verified with unique content in all tabs ✅

**Git Commits:**
- `55701e0` - fix: align recovery graph actual line with estimated timeline
- Previous: `56faac2` - fix: disable mock data in summary generation to enable unique AI summaries

**Next Action:** Continue with any user-requested features or improvements
