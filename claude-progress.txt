# Preventli Progress Snapshot - Session Handoff

## Session 36 - 2026-01-27 - Disk Cleanup & Project Migration

### Completed
- ✅ **Tested employer login successfully**
  - Server started on port 5000
  - Logged in as employer@test.com
  - Verified Symmetry Human Resources Dashboard loads (37 cases, 20 critical actions)

- ✅ **Disk space crisis managed**
  - C: drive was critically low (~145 MB free)
  - Cleared: Recycle Bin, npm cache, browser caches, VS Code cache, temp files
  - Freed ~1GB through various cleanups

- ✅ **Migrated all projects to D: drive**
  - Copied entire C:\dev to D:\dev using PowerShell
  - gpnet3 and all other projects now on D:\dev
  - D: drive has ~12 GB free after migration

### In Progress
- **C:\dev deletion pending** - User needs to manually delete C:\dev folder
  - All projects safely copied to D:\dev
  - C: still has ~144 MB free (will be ~2-3 GB after C:\dev deleted)

- **Natalie UAT setup** - ngrok needs auth token
  - UAT test plan ready: NATALIE_EMPLOYER_UAT.md
  - ngrok setup guide: NGROK_SETUP_FOR_NATALIE.md
  - Credentials: employer@test.com / password123

### Git Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Untracked files**: Utility scripts (scripts/*.cjs), alert-dialog.tsx
- **No uncommitted changes** to tracked files

### Next Steps
1. **Delete C:\dev folder manually** (free 2-3 GB on C:)
   - Open File Explorer → C:\ → Right-click dev → Delete
   - Empty Recycle Bin

2. **Update working directory for future sessions**
   - Projects now at D:\dev\gpnet3 (not C:\dev\gpnet3)
   - May need to update terminal/IDE paths

3. **Configure ngrok for Natalie's testing**
   - Run: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN`
   - Then: `ngrok http 5000`
   - Share URL with Natalie

4. **Resume certificate image debugging**
   - documentUrl not appearing in API response
   - Files to check: server/routes/timeline.ts, server/services/recoveryEstimator.ts

### Project Location Change
**IMPORTANT**: Projects moved from C:\dev to D:\dev
- Old path: C:\dev\gpnet3
- New path: D:\dev\gpnet3
- After deleting C:\dev, work from D:\dev\gpnet3

### Blockers
- C: drive still low (~144 MB) until C:\dev is deleted
- ngrok auth token not configured

### Notes
- Server was running on port 5000 before handoff (now stopped)
- Browser session tested employer login successfully
- All data safely on D: drive - can safely delete C:\dev
