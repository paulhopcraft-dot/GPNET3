## Session 12 - 2026-01-21 - Medical Certificate Worker Alert System Implementation

### Completed
- **✅ Medical Certificate Worker Alert System**: Successfully implemented complete button-triggered worker email alert system
  - ✅ **Dashboard Button**: Added "Send Cert Alerts" button to main dashboard next to Sync Freshdesk button
  - ✅ **API Endpoint**: Created `/api/notifications/send-certificate-alerts` with admin auth, error handling, audit logging
  - ✅ **Worker Email Lookup**: `getWorkerEmail()` function queries `case_contacts` table for role="worker" with validation
  - ✅ **Worker Alert Service**: `sendWorkerCertificateAlerts()` function with 3-7 day expiry window and deduplication logic
  - ✅ **Direct Email Sending**: Emails sent directly to workers (not admin) with proper notification records and status tracking
  - ✅ **Error Handling & UX**: Toast notifications show "Sent X certificate alerts to workers" with detailed error reporting

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Button Integration**: Added to GPNet2Dashboard.tsx with loading states and Material Design icons
- **API Route**: Added to `server/routes/notifications.ts` with admin authorization requirement
- **Service Function**: Added to `server/services/notificationService.ts` with full compliance integration
- **Worker Email Query**: `SELECT email FROM case_contacts WHERE role='worker'` with email validation
- **Deduplication**: Uses `worker_cert:${caseId}:${bucketedDays}` keys to prevent spam
- **Compliance Integration**: Uses existing `getCaseCompliance()` function for 3-7 day expiry detection

### User Todo Items Added During Session
- Fix dashboard title: Change "Preventli" to "(Client) - Case Management Dashboard"
- Remove critical actions required bar at top (redundant with 3-column action layout)

### Current State Assessment
- **Server**: Running perfectly on http://localhost:5000 with all features functional
- **Medical Certificate Alerts**: CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE - ready for testing
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated with existing notification and compliance systems
- **User Experience**: Professional button placement with proper loading states and feedback

### Next Steps (Ready for Next Session)
1. **Test Worker Alert System**: Click "Send Cert Alerts" button to test complete workflow
2. **Enhanced Email Templates**: Create worker-friendly email content (less technical, more supportive)
3. **Individual Case Buttons**: Add "Send Alert to Worker" buttons on case detail pages
4. **Dashboard UI Improvements**: Fix branding and remove redundant action bar
5. **RTW Plan Expiry Alerts**: Implement screen alerts for RTW plan expiry detection

### Technical Context for Next Session
- **Core Functionality Complete**: Button → API → Worker Email Lookup → Email Sending → Status Reporting
- **Integration Ready**: All existing compliance and notification infrastructure leveraged
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and user feedback implemented
- **Plan File**: C:\Users\Paul\.claude\plans\squishy-brewing-hopcroft.md contains full implementation plan
- **Implementation Status**: 3/7 core todos complete (button, API, email lookup)
