## Critical System Problems Identified

### 1. Selective Evidence ("Cherry-Picking")
**Problem**: Agents selectively use medical evidence to terminate entitlements, ignoring treating physician reports in favor of adverse opinions.

- **Compliance Alerts**: Flags when decisions contradict treating physician evidence
- **Transparent Documentation**: Complete evidence history visible to all stakeholders

**Value**: Prevents wrongful terminations, reduces dispute costs, ensures fair outcomes

### 2. Financial Incentives for Terminations
**Problem**: Agent contracts reward terminating claims to maximize profit rather than ensuring fair outcomes.

**Preventli Solution**:
- **Outcome Tracking**: Monitor actual vs. projected case costs and durations
- **Quality Metrics**: Track case outcomes beyond just closure rates
- **Compliance Scoring**: Rate agents on adherence to WorkSafe guidelines, not just cost reduction
- **Performance Transparency**: Detailed reporting on agent decision patterns

**Value**: Aligns incentives with proper case management, reduces scheme liability

**Preventli Solution**:
- **Complex Case AI**: Enhanced AI analysis for multi-factor cases
- **Specialist Workflows**: Dedicated processes for mental health and complex injury claims
