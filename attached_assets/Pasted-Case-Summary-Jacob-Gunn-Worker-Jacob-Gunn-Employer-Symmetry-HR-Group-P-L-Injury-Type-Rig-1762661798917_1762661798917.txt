Worker: Jacob Gunn
 Employer: Symmetry HR (Group P/L)
 Injury Type: Right shoulder/arm pain (sustained while working at a host site)
 Status: Active — WorkCover claim in progress

Where We Are Now
Claim Stage:


A WorkCover claim has been lodged and is being managed by DXC Claims Management Services.


AP Security Group  is conducting a circumstantial investigation on behalf of DXC.
Investigator: Patrick Rampal (DXC appointed).
Jacob has been asked to provide written responses to questions about his injury and employment details.


Medical:


He has ongoing symptoms with limited recovery despite physiotherapy and modified duties.
GPNet has been paying wages for approximately 14 weeks and covering physiotherapy sessions.
He’s been instructed to obtain medical clearance specifically for forklift (LF) duties only before returning to any site placement.


Employment / Placement:
Symmetry and GPNet are looking to secure a suitable role for Jacob in the Southeast area 
Return-to-Work Plan draft is ready pending confirmation of position description, supervisor details, and induction information from Michelle Clarkson (Symmetry).


Documentation:
WorkCover investigation documents are being compiled by GPNet and Symmetry for submission to DXC and AP Security.
Missing items are being followed up urgently to avoid delays in claim finalisation and wage reimbursement transfer from WorkCover to DXC.



Next Steps / Recommended Actions
For Jacob (GPNet to coordinate):
Obtain medical clearance for forklift duties only, not general labour.
Jacob responded that he will be going to the doctor today and confirmed the he won’t be able to start on 3rd November but will be able to on the 5th.
Provide any new Certificate of Capacity or GP update to GPNet for file.
For Symmetry (Michelle Clarkson ):
Forward any remaining host-side documents (injury reports, statements, risk assessments) to GPNet today for inclusion in the DXC bundle.
For GPNet:
Finalise and issue Return-to-Work Plan once Symmetry confirms role and supervisor.
Submit complete investigation document set to DXC and AP Security for claim closure review.
For DXC Claims Management:
Await full document bundle before finalising liability decision.

Overall Outlook
Once the remaining documents are submitted and medical clearance is confirmed, the claim should stabilise under DXC. The priority is now administrative closure of the investigation and formal transfer of financial responsibility.
