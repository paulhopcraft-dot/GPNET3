Hi team — could you please help verify that all recent GPNet 3 updates are properly reflected and working inside this workspace?

Over the past few days we’ve applied multiple backend and frontend changes, and we just want to confirm everything is correctly wired before continuing development.

Here’s what we need you to check and confirm:
	1.	Backend (Express + API endpoints)
	•	The /api/cases route is running from the new server/routes/cases.ts file and returns case data including compliance_level, risk_level, next_step_owner, and expected_recovery_date.
	•	The /api/voice placeholder route loads correctly without errors.
	•	index.ts correctly imports the routes using explicit .js extensions (import casesRoute from "./routes/cases.js" etc.).
	•	The server runs successfully on port 5000 with no missing-module or ESM path errors.
	2.	Frontend (Vite + React)
	•	The Vite dev server correctly locates and loads /client/src/main.tsx.
	•	The app renders without [replit-cartographer] traverse is not a function errors or PostCSS “from option” warnings.
	•	If Cartographer is still active, please ensure it’s compatible with this build or disabled in favor of our custom vite.config.ts.
	3.	Compliance System Integration
	•	The Claude-powered compliance scoring logic is present and accessible via the /api/cases output.
	•	The system can compute compliance dynamically based on case data (certificate recency, update frequency, employer response, etc.).
	•	Confirm that Claude Skills are properly referenced and that the workspace can later ingest the WorkSafe manuals for deeper reasoning.
	4.	Timeline Graph
	•	The frontend includes a horizontal (weeks) × vertical (capacity %) recovery timeline graph showing both expected and actual recovery.
	•	Verify the graph renders correctly and updates with new data from the API.
	5.	AI Summary Chat Panel
	•	Confirm that the “Smart AI Summary Chat” interface is active — it should allow natural language interrogation of a worker’s case (“How compliant is [Name]?”, “What’s blocking their return to work?”).
	6.	UI Adjustments
	•	The redundant summary lines have been removed from case cards.
	•	The eight-column layout (Worker, Employer, Injury Type, Claim Status, Compliance, Risk Level, Next Step Owner, Timeline) is visible.

If any of these modules fail to load or are missing, please let us know which components are not linked so we can re-sync the codebase.
