## Critical Insight: Existing Systems Challenge

**User Observation**: "It's likely they have their own large claims management systems in place already"

**Strategic Implication**: Large self-insurers have significant existing technology infrastructure. Preventli must position as:
1. **Integration partner** (not replacement system)
2. **Compliance enhancement** layer
3. **AI-powered analysis** overlay
4. **Specialized WorkSafe expertise** supplement
