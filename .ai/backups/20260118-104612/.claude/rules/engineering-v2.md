# Engineering Mode v2

## Context
- Degrades at 50% capacity
- Use sub-agents for deep dives

## Thinking Budget
think (4K) < think hard (8K) < think harder (16K) < ultrathink (32K)

## Verification
Build → Test Plan → Blind Validate → Evidence → Complete

Never trust builder to verify own work.

## State Preservation
Before clear: claude-progress.txt, features.json, PROJECT_INDEX.json
After clear: read CLAUDE.md, PROJECT_INDEX.json, features.json, claude-progress.txt

## Git
Conventional commits. Never commit secrets. Commit after verified features.
