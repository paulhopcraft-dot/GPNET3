**Subject:** WorkSafe Compliance Enhancement for University Self-Insurers
**Priority:** Normal

**EMAIL CONTENT:**

Dear WAIS Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out regarding Preventli, a specialized WorkSafe Victoria compliance intelligence platform designed specifically for large self-insurers like the University of Melbourne.

**Why I'm contacting you:**

As you know, the University operates as an approved self-insurer under the WIRC Act, managing workers compensation claims across a diverse workforce of 40,000+ employees. Recent Victorian Ombudsman findings have highlighted systemic challenges in claims management, particularly around compliance oversight and complex claim handling - areas where universities face unique challenges due to research facilities, diverse risk profiles, and regulatory complexity.

**What Preventli offers:**

Preventli enhances existing claims management systems (rather than replacing them) by providing:
- AI-powered WorkSafe compliance checking and alerts
- Early identification of complex claims (which typically represent 20% of cases but 80-90% of costs)
- University-specific features for research facilities, student workers, and academic environments
- Automated compliance reporting for WorkSafe Victoria audits

**Our university focus:**

We understand the unique challenges of university environments:
- Laboratory and research facility injuries
- Mixed workforce (academic, research, support, medical staff)
- Student worker vs. staff claim differentiation
- Academic calendar seasonality
- Multi-campus coordination requirements

**The conversation I'm requesting:**

I'd welcome a brief 20-minute phone call to:
1. Understand your current claims management processes and any WorkSafe compliance challenges
2. Learn about your existing systems and integration requirements
3. Demonstrate how Preventli could enhance your current approach (if relevant)

**No obligation - just an exploratory conversation.**

Our clients typically see 20% reductions in complex claim costs and 40% fewer disputes, while maintaining their existing workflow and systems. Given the University's substantial self-insurer operations, even modest improvements can deliver significant value.

Would next week work for a brief discussion? I'm flexible with timing and happy to work around your schedule.

Thank you for your time and the important work you do supporting University employees.

Best regards,
