## Notes

- ${workerCase.workerName} needs to sustain employment for ~3 months for claim to be considered stable from WorkCover perspective (target: 8 March 2026)
- If ${workerCase.workerName}'s employment ends due to accepted injury, claim may be reopened and weekly payments reinstated (subject to review of medical evidence)
- ${workerCase.workerName} retains entitlement to reasonable medical and like expenses regardless of employment status
- Long commute noted as concern (2 trains, 1 bus, 25-min walk from Sunshine to worksite)
- Previous host employers declined to have ${workerCase.workerName} back (Pact/VIP Steel, Sunshine Hospital, Clayton office)
- Worker reported manager "yells at people" - someone quit due to this; monitor for disengagement risk`;

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Start with "Work Status Classification: [classification]" on the first line
2. Use markdown tables for structured data
3. Include specific dates and amounts wherever available
4. Action items MUST be specific with clear assignees and deadlines
5. Risk register should identify real risks based on case data
6. Be comprehensive - this is the primary case management tool
7. Use professional tone suitable for legal/medical context
8. Only write "Insufficient data" for sections where truly no information is available`;
