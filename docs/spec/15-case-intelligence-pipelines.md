# 15 — Case Intelligence & Storage Pipelines

The case intelligence pipeline processes diverse data types including documents, emails, interview transcripts, check-in responses, behaviour signals, and predictive model outputs into a unified intelligence layer. The pipeline follows a consistent flow: ingestion of raw data from various sources, normalization into standard formats and schemas, indexing for efficient retrieval and search, and generation of vector embeddings for semantic similarity and AI-powered analysis.

Stored intelligence supports multiple use cases including semantic search across all case documentation, context retrieval for AI-powered features like the avatar and summary engines, trend analysis to identify patterns across similar cases, and anomaly detection to flag unusual case characteristics or progressions. The pipeline maintains both structured data for precise queries and unstructured content for natural language processing.

This intelligence infrastructure enables GPNet's advanced AI features to provide context-aware recommendations, generate accurate summaries, and identify relevant precedents from historical cases. The centralized storage and processing approach ensures consistent data quality while supporting scalable analytics as case volumes grow.
