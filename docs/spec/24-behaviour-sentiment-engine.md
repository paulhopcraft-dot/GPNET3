# 24 — Worker Behaviour & Sentiment Pattern Engine

The behaviour and sentiment engine analyzes worker interactions across multiple channels to identify patterns that may indicate engagement, distress, or disengagement. Input sources include email communications with tone and sentiment analysis, avatar and interview transcripts capturing worker narratives and emotional state, check-in responses tracking mood and functional status over time, and attendance patterns for appointments, check-ins, and return-to-work shifts. Advanced natural language processing identifies sentiment trends, linguistic markers of distress or frustration, and changes in communication patterns.

Engine outputs include sentiment trend visualization showing improvement, stability, or deterioration in worker affect and engagement, engagement scores quantifying worker responsiveness and participation in the case management process, and risk flags triggered by concerning patterns such as increasingly negative sentiment, withdrawal from communication, missed appointments, or expressions of hopelessness. These signals enable proactive intervention before situations escalate to crises or formal disputes.

Behavioural insights inform case prioritization, with disengaged or deteriorating workers flagged for enhanced support and outreach. The engine helps case managers identify workers who may benefit from additional psychosocial support, mediation of workplace conflicts, or referral to specialized services. All analysis respects privacy boundaries, with sentiment data used solely to improve case management quality and worker outcomes, not for punitive purposes.
