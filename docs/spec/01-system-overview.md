# 01 — System Overview

GPNet is a B2B platform designed for employers, host sites, and case managers to manage workers with injuries or health-related issues. The platform automates certificate tracking, compliance monitoring, and follow-up processes while coordinating return-to-work planning and redeployment strategies. It centralizes all communication channels including emails, Freshdesk tickets, and documents, providing AI-assisted decision support through avatars, summaries, predictions, and risk assessments.

The core purpose of GPNet is to prevent workers from being "lost in the system" while enabling earlier and safer return-to-work outcomes where appropriate. By reducing administrative load and manual tracking, the platform ensures better documentation for regulators, insurers, and dispute resolution. GPNet serves as the single timeline of truth per worker, creating a comprehensive operational intelligence layer for injury management.

The product is split into two main components: the marketing site at gpnet.au for sales, branding, and lead generation, and the secure portal at portal.gpnet.au serving as the employer and case manager workspace. This separation ensures public-facing content remains distinct from authenticated, sensitive case management operations.
