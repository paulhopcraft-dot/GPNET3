# 22 — HR / Termination & Employment Integration

The HR and termination integration module tracks the intersection of injury management with employment lifecycle events, particularly focusing on high-risk termination scenarios. The system monitors leave usage including annual leave, sick leave, and unpaid leave balances to provide visibility into exhausted entitlements that may trigger termination discussions. Documentation of return-to-work attempts, compliance with medical recommendations, and engagement efforts creates a defensible record for employment decisions.

Risk assessment capabilities identify red flags when termination is contemplated for workers with active injury cases, including potential adverse action claims, discrimination risks under disability legislation, workers' compensation retaliation prohibitions, and inadequate accommodation efforts. The system generates comprehensive case documentation packages suitable for legal review prior to termination decisions, ensuring all relevant medical, engagement, and compliance information is considered.

Integration with HR systems supports coordinated decision-making between injury case management and employment management functions. The module does not make termination decisions but ensures decision-makers have complete information about injury status, return-to-work efforts, medical restrictions, and legal risks. This integration protects both the organisation and injured workers by ensuring employment decisions are informed, defensible, and compliant with overlapping legal frameworks.
