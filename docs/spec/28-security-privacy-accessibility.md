# 28 — Security, Privacy, Accessibility

Security controls protect sensitive health and employment data through multiple layers of defense. Password policies enforce minimum complexity requirements, regular rotation, and protection against common attacks such as credential stuffing and brute force attempts. Multi-factor authentication is available as an optional additional security layer for organisations with heightened security requirements. JWT token rotation with short-lived access tokens and secure refresh token management prevents session hijacking, while rate limiting on authentication and API endpoints protects against denial-of-service and enumeration attacks.

Privacy protections implement data minimization principles, collecting only information necessary for injury case management and return-to-work coordination. Configurable retention policies automatically purge data when regulatory retention periods expire, reducing ongoing privacy risk. Access controls enforce strict organisation-scope boundaries ensuring complete tenant isolation in the multi-tenant architecture, with role-based permissions limiting user access to appropriate cases and functions within their organisation.

Accessibility compliance targets WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards ensuring the platform is usable by people with diverse abilities. Implementation includes proper semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation support for users who cannot use pointing devices, sufficient color contrast for users with visual impairments, and clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation. Regular accessibility testing and remediation maintain compliance as new features are developed.
