# 14 — Multi-Source Timeline Engine

The timeline engine aggregates events from multiple data sources into a unified chronological view of each worker's case. Source events include medical certificate submissions and expirations, email communications with all parties, structured check-in responses, return-to-work status changes and plan modifications, avatar conversation sessions, clinical reports and assessments, and automated actions taken by the system. This comprehensive aggregation creates a single source of truth for case history and progression.

The timeline interface provides powerful filtering capabilities allowing users to focus on specific event types, time ranges, or parties involved in communications. Drill-down functionality enables users to access the full context of any timeline event, such as reading complete email threads or reviewing detailed check-in responses. The timeline automatically highlights key transitions such as fitness status changes, return-to-work milestones, and compliance flags.

This multi-source integration eliminates the need for case managers to reconstruct case history from disparate systems and documents. The timeline serves both operational case management needs and regulatory documentation requirements, providing clear evidence of actions taken, decisions made, and the complete sequence of events in any worker's case.
