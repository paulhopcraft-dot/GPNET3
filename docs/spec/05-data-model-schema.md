# 05 — Data Model & Database Schema

The GPNet data model is built on a comprehensive Postgres schema supporting multi-tenant operations with site-scoped roles, full auditing, and soft delete capabilities. Core entities include Organisation, Site, User, Worker, Case, Check, EmailMessage/Ticket, Certificate, Document, Action, Rule, Template, and TimelineEvent representing the foundational operational data. Additional entities support specialized functionality including RTWPlan for return-to-work coordination, Payment/WageRecord for financial tracking, and AuditEvent for compliance and change tracking.

Knowledge and intelligence layers are supported through entities such as KnowledgeDocument for storing organisational policies and industry protocols, Prediction for analytics outputs, AvatarSession for tracking AI-assisted conversations, and BehaviourSignal for capturing worker engagement patterns. The schema enforces strong referential integrity through foreign key constraints, ensuring data consistency across related entities while supporting complex queries and reporting requirements.

The multi-tenant architecture ensures complete data isolation between organisations while allowing for efficient resource utilization and centralized management. Audit trails capture all significant changes to cases, workers, and system configurations, providing comprehensive compliance documentation and supporting dispute resolution processes. Soft delete functionality preserves historical data while marking records as inactive, maintaining data integrity for long-running cases and regulatory requirements.
