# 12 — User Cases & User Journeys

GPNet serves multiple personas with distinct needs and interaction patterns including employers managing workplace safety obligations, case managers coordinating complex injury cases, host supervisors overseeing return-to-work placements, workers navigating recovery and return-to-work processes, general practitioners providing medical treatment and certification, and physiotherapists supporting rehabilitation. Each persona has specific touchpoints with the system and distinct information needs throughout the case lifecycle.

Key user journeys are mapped across common scenarios including new injury reporting and initial response, management of long-term chronic conditions requiring ongoing monitoring, pre-employment medical assessments and clearances, and exit assessments when employment concludes. These journeys identify critical decision points, information requirements, communication needs, and success criteria specific to each scenario type.

Understanding these journeys ensures the platform delivers the right information and functionality at the right time for each user type. Journey mapping informs the design of automation rules, the structure of user interfaces, the content of communications, and the prioritization of features to support the most common and critical workflows across all personas.
