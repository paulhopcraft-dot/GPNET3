# 19 — Tele-Health / Physio Avatar Extension

The telehealth and physiotherapy avatar extends the core avatar capabilities with specialized clinical assessment functions focused on physical rehabilitation. The avatar conducts structured symptom assessments covering pain location, intensity, and character, performs activities of daily living evaluations to understand functional limitations, implements pain mapping to identify affected areas and movement restrictions, and provides guidance on safe exercises appropriate for the worker's current condition and restrictions.

Critical safety features include red flag detection for symptoms indicating serious underlying conditions requiring immediate medical attention, such as signs of infection, neurological compromise, or cardiovascular concerns. When red flags are detected, the avatar immediately escalates to human clinical review and recommends urgent medical evaluation. Exercise recommendations are conservative and based on established clinical protocols, with clear instructions on warning signs that should prompt cessation of activity.

This telehealth extension democratizes access to rehabilitation guidance, particularly valuable for workers in remote locations or outside standard clinical hours. The avatar does not replace physiotherapy treatment but provides interim support, reinforces prescribed exercises, monitors progress between appointments, and identifies when workers should seek in-person clinical care. All avatar sessions are logged and integrated into the case timeline for continuity of care.
