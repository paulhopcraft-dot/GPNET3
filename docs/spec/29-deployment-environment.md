# 29 — Deployment & Environment Setup

GPNet operates across multiple environments to support development, testing, and production operations. The development environment supports local developer machines and shared development servers for active feature development and integration testing. The staging environment provides a production-like setting for user acceptance testing, performance validation, and final verification before production deployment. The production environment serves live customer operations with full monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery capabilities.

Deployment processes utilize standardized build scripts ensuring consistent compilation, bundling, and optimization across environments. Environment-specific configuration is managed through environment variables or configuration files that specify database connections, API endpoints, feature flags, and integration credentials without embedding secrets in code. Comprehensive deployment documentation in DEPLOY.md guides operations teams through deployment procedures, rollback processes, and troubleshooting common issues.

Observability infrastructure provides real-time visibility into system health and performance through structured logging capturing application events, errors, and audit information, metrics collection and dashboards monitoring request rates, response times, error rates, and resource utilization, automated backup procedures for database and critical configuration data, and queue health monitoring for asynchronous job processing systems. Alert configuration ensures operations teams are notified of critical issues requiring immediate attention, supporting rapid incident response and resolution.
