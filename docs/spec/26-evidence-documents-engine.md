# 26 — Evidence & Document Management Engine

The document management engine provides centralized storage, organization, and retrieval for all case-related documentation. Supported document types include medical certificates establishing work capacity and restrictions, scanned documents such as incident reports and witness statements, GP and specialist clinical notes providing treatment history, signed statements from workers, supervisors, or witnesses, imaging reports, pathology results, and other clinical evidence. The engine handles diverse file formats including PDFs, images, and office documents with appropriate preview and rendering capabilities.

Core functionality includes secure upload with virus scanning and file validation, preview generation for quick document review without downloads, comprehensive tagging and metadata management for organization and filtering, full-text search enabling rapid location of specific information across all documents, and automatic linking to workers, cases, and timeline events for contextual retrieval. Version control maintains document history when updated versions are uploaded, preserving the complete evidence chain.

The document engine integrates with the certificate ingestion pipeline for automated processing of medical certificates, with the compliance engine to monitor certificate expiry and identify missing documentation, and with the timeline to provide chronological context for when each document was created or received. Document access is controlled by role-based permissions ensuring privacy compliance, and all document access is logged in audit trails supporting regulatory requirements and dispute preparation.
