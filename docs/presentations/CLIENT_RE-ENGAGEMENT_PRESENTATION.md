# SLIDE 2: The GPNet Evolution

## GPNet Then vs Now

| **Insights** | Basic reporting | Predictive analytics & risk scoring |
| **Certificates** | Document storage | Intelligent extraction & expiry tracking |
| **Communication** | Separate channels | Integrated ingestion & sentiment analysis |
| **RTW Planning** | Static plans | Dynamic, evidence-based RTW intelligence |
| **Evidence** | Scattered documentation | Unified timeline with audit trail |

**Key Message:**
> "We didn't just update GPNet - we reimagined it from the ground up based on what organisations like yours actually need in today's compliance environment."

### 2. Predictive Analytics

- Identify high-risk cases early
- Data-driven prioritization of your caseload

### 3. Automated Compliance Engine
- Real-time monitoring against business rules
- Certificate expiry tracking with escalation

---

# SLIDE 4: Market Reality

## The Compliance Landscape Has Changed

### WorkSafe Victoria - 2024-2026 Developments

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Increased Penalties** | Maximum fines have increased significantly; non-compliance costs more than ever |
| **Documentation Requirements** | More detailed evidence expectations for disputes and audits |
| **Response Time Expectations** | Tighter windows for employer actions on certificates and RTW |
| **Mental Health Claims** | Growing category requiring specialized tracking and support |
| **Psychosocial Hazards** | New obligations around workplace psychological safety |

### The Problem with Manual Processes

- **Missed Deadlines:** Certificate expiries slip through the cracks
- **Scattered Data:** Evidence spread across emails, drives, and systems
- **Reactive Management:** Issues discovered too late to prevent escalation
- **Audit Vulnerability:** Incomplete documentation creates regulatory risk
- **Staff Turnover:** Institutional knowledge walks out the door

**Key Message:**
> "The processes that worked 2-3 years ago are now high-risk. Manual tracking creates gaps that regulators and insurers will find."

# SLIDE 11: Cost of Non-Compliance

## What's at Stake Without Proper Systems

### Direct Costs
| Risk | Potential Cost |
|------|----------------|
| WorkSafe breach penalty | $50,000 - $500,000+ |
| Premium increase from poor claims management | 15-30% annual increase |
| Disputed claim legal fees | $20,000 - $100,000+ per case |
| Regulatory investigation costs | $50,000+ in staff time and fees |

### Indirect Costs
- **Reputation damage** from publicized breaches
- **Staff turnover** from administrative burden
- **Productivity loss** from managing crises vs prevention
- **Insurer relationship strain** from poor documentation

### The Hidden Cost of Manual Processes
> "Every day with manual processes is a day where something important might slip through. The question isn't whether you'll have a gap - it's whether you'll catch it in time."
