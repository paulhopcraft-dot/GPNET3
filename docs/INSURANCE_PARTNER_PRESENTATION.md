# THE MARKET PROBLEM

## WorkSafe Compliance Challenges

### Current State: Manual, Fragmented, Risky

**Employers Face:**
| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Scattered documentation | Critical certificates lost in email |
| Manual deadline tracking | Missed compliance obligations |
| No single source of truth | Conflicting information across systems |
| Reactive case management | Workers "lost in the system" |
| Paper-based processes | Audit failures and penalties |

**The Cost of Non-Compliance:**

- **Financial Penalties:** WorkSafe Victoria penalties for compliance breaches
- **Premium Impacts:** Poor claims experience affects employer premiums
- **Dispute Costs:** Inadequate documentation leads to costly disputes
- **RTW Delays:** Manual processes extend time-off-work duration
- **Administrative Burden:** 40%+ of case manager time on admin tasks

### Regulatory Complexity

**Key Compliance Requirements (WIRC Act 2013):**
- Medical certificates must be current for workers off work
- RTW plans required within 10 weeks for serious injuries
- Case reviews mandatory every 8 weeks
- Payment step-downs at 13 weeks must be documented
- Centrelink clearance required before payments
- Suitable duties must be offered when capacity exists

**Reality Check:**
Most employers track these requirements manually using spreadsheets, calendar reminders, and email folders. Compliance gaps are discovered only when disputes arise.
