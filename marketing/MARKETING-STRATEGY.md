# Preventli Marketing Strategy

## Brand Positioning

### Brand Promise
**"No Worker Lost in the System"**

### Positioning Statement
Preventli is the AI-powered claims intelligence platform that transforms chaotic WorkCover management into confident compliance. For employers, self-insurers, and insurance companies who are tired of spreadsheets, missed deadlines, and preventable penalties, Preventli delivers automated compliance tracking, AI-powered case summaries, and predictive risk detection - all purpose-built for WorkSafe Victoria.

### Brand Personality
- **Expert but Accessible**: Deep WorkCover knowledge without jargon
- **Confident but not Arrogant**: We know our value, we let results speak
- **Direct**: Hormozi-style - clear, specific, outcome-focused
- **Human**: Technology that helps people, not replaces them

### Tone of Voice
- Use numbers and specifics (not "improve compliance" → "$688,000 in savings")
- Lead with pain points, solve with outcomes
- Avoid buzzwords (no "synergy," "leverage," "best-in-class")
- Speak to the person, not the organization

## Quick Reference: Elevator Pitches

### 10-Second (All)
"Preventli is AI-powered WorkCover management. We track compliance, automate alerts, and get workers back faster."

### 30-Second (Employer)
"Most employers lose 8+ hours a week chasing WorkCover certificates and praying they don't miss a deadline. Preventli automates all of that. One dashboard for all your injured workers, automatic alerts before anything's due, and AI summaries so you're always in the loop. Companies using Preventli save $40K+ a year. Want to see a demo?"

### 30-Second (Self-Insurer)
"Your self-insurance license is your most valuable compliance asset, but you're probably tracking obligations in spreadsheets. Preventli monitors 73+ WorkSafe rules automatically, gives you board-ready compliance reports, and flags risks before they become penalties. Our clients see 720% ROI and zero audit surprises. Can we show you how?"

### 30-Second (Insurance)
"What if your claims operation generated revenue instead of just costs? Preventli is an AI-powered claims platform you can license to your employer clients - $50 per case, you keep 50% margin. Plus it cuts your own claims duration by 15%. Partners are projecting $1.5M in new revenue. Worth 30 minutes?"
