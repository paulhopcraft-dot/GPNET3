# Claude Progress - Session 2025-12-24

## Session Summary

Designed the Weekly Check-ins feature (F020) through collaborative discussion.

## What Was Completed

1. Reviewed domain_memory.json - all 19 existing features complete
2. Identified Weekly Check-ins (spec 09) as next priority feature
3. Designed full conversational architecture through discussion:
   - Context-aware question generation based on case state
   - Case-type templates (physio, mental health, general)
   - Multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, Zoom, voice)
   - V1 = typing (web form), V2 = voice + avatar
   - Escalation triggers and data flow
4. Created comprehensive handoff document
5. Created and pushed feature branch

## What's In Progress

- **Feature:** Weekly Check-ins (F020)
- **Branch:** `claude/weekly-checkins-xg7ww`
- **Handoff:** `.claude/handoff-weekly-checkins.md`
- **Status:** Planned, ready for implementation

## Exact Next Step

1. Checkout branch: `git checkout claude/weekly-checkins-xg7ww`
2. Read handoff: `.claude/handoff-weekly-checkins.md`
3. Start with Implementation Step 1: Schema + Migration

## Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Interaction versioning | V1=form, V2=voice+avatar | Build data layer first, add renderers later |
| SMS provider | Abstract (Twilio/Vonage/Plivo) | Config-based selection, no vendor lock-in |
| Question generation | Context-aware, not static | Reviews case type, cert status, trends before asking |
| Pain scale | 1=none, 10=severe | Medical convention |
| Check-in target | Active RTW cases only | ~100 workers/week expected volume |
| Architecture | Conversation nodes with branching | Supports future voice/avatar without rewrite |

## Blockers
