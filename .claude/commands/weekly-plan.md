⚠️ Limited historical data for accurate planning

Using general productivity patterns.

Improve future planning by:
• Completing daily reviews
• Tracking task completion data
• Recording energy patterns

Proceeding with basic weekly framework...
```

**Overambitious Planning**:
```
⚠️ Planned workload exceeds realistic capacity

Planned: [planned_hours]h
Realistic capacity: [realistic_hours]h
Overcommitment: [excess_hours]h ([percentage]%)

Recommendations:
• Defer [suggested_deferrals]
• Reduce scope: [scope_reduction_options]
• Extend timeline: [timeline_adjustment_options]

Proceed with adjusted plan? (y/n)
```
