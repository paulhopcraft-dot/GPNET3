# Engineering Mode v4.0 - Power User Configuration

## 🎯 Paul's Personal Preferences (Auto-Applied)

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite (NEVER vanilla HTML/JS)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- Database: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (NEVER MySQL/Sequelize)
- Testing: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E

**Code Quality Rules:**
- Configuration: Read from JSON/YAML files (NO hardcoding)
- Error Handling: Comprehensive try/catch with logging
- TypeScript: Strict mode, explicit return types
- Git: Conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/refactor)

**Skill Focus (Use These 5 ONLY):**
- `/status` - Check project health and next actions
- `/continue` - Pick up where we left off
- `/review` - Code review before committing
- `/commit` - Save progress with conventional commits
- `/test` - Run test suite and verify quality

**Skills to Ignore (Mental Filter):**
- All 30+ other skills - focus only on the 5 above
- When Claude suggests skills, mentally filter to these 5
- Productivity = focus, not more options

**Session Management:**
- Auto-handoff at 70% context usage
- Always run `/status` after completing any task
- Use `/handoff` before ending sessions
- Load context from claude-progress.txt on session start
- Auto-start branch display in console title
- Auto-start context monitoring: & 'C:\dev\claude-code-toolkit\start-context-monitor.ps1'

**CRITICAL: Exact Context Display Rule:**
- NEVER use approximations (~XX%) for context usage
- ALWAYS use exact tracking: `powershell -Command "& 'C:\dev\claude-code-toolkit\context-tracker.ps1' -Action status"`
- End every response with: "Branch: [branch] | Context: [exact tokens]/1000000 = [exact %]"
- This prevents regression to estimation system

**Auto-Command Recommendations (ENABLED):**
- After completing ANY task, automatically suggest next slash command
- Use smart-command-recommender.ps1 to analyze context and suggest optimal next step
- Display recommendation with reasoning and priority level
- Follow Power User workflow patterns for maximum efficiency

## Workflow Pattern

**Standard Development Flow (WITH AUTO-RECOMMENDATIONS):**
1. `/status` - What's the current state?
2. `/continue` - Pick next logical task
3. Work on task using above preferences
4. `/test` - Verify it works → **[AUTO-SUGGEST: `/review` if pass, `/continue` if fail]**
5. `/review` - Check quality → **[AUTO-SUGGEST: `/commit` if good, `/continue` if issues]**
6. `/commit` - Save with conventional message → **[AUTO-SUGGEST: `/status` to check progress]**
7. `/status` - Show progress, recommend next → **[AUTO-SUGGEST: `/continue` for next priority]**

**Auto-Recommendation Behavior:**
- ALWAYS run `.\auto-recommend-hook.ps1 -CompletedCommand "[command]" -Status "[status]"` after task completion
- Display the suggestion prominently with reasoning
- Include priority level (🔴 HIGH, 🟡 MEDIUM, ✅ SUGGESTED)
- Respect user preferences but proactively guide workflow efficiency

**Never deviate from this workflow without explicit user request.**
