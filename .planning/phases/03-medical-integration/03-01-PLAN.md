<objective>
Create the restriction extraction service that parses medical certificate data into structured FunctionalRestrictions format using Claude Haiku.

Purpose: MED-01, MED-02, MED-03 through MED-08 depend on having structured extraction of restrictions from certificate data. This service transforms semi-structured certificate notes and restriction arrays into the FunctionalRestrictions interface that matches the RTW duty demands structure.

Output: restrictionExtractor.ts service with LLM-based extraction, schema updated with functionalRestrictionsJson field
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add functionalRestrictionsJson field to medical_certificates schema</name>
  <files>shared/schema.ts</files>
  <action>
Add a new JSONB field `functionalRestrictionsJson` to the `medicalCertificates` table definition (around line 778, after rawExtractedData).

The field should store structured FunctionalRestrictions data:
```typescript
functionalRestrictionsJson: jsonb("functional_restrictions_json").$type<FunctionalRestrictions | null>(),
```

Also add time limit fields that research identified as important (around the FunctionalRestrictions interface or as part of the extraction result):
- maxWorkHoursPerDay?: number
- maxWorkDaysPerWeek?: number

These can be added to the interface or stored alongside in the JSONB.

Do NOT modify the RestrictionItem type or existing restrictions field - we augment, not replace.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - TypeScript compiles without errors.
Check that FunctionalRestrictions interface exists and medical_certificates table has the new field.
  </verify>
  <done>
medical_certificates table has functionalRestrictionsJson field that can store FunctionalRestrictions data.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create restrictionExtractor.ts service</name>
  <files>server/services/restrictionExtractor.ts</files>
  <action>
Create a new service file at `server/services/restrictionExtractor.ts` that:

1. Imports Anthropic SDK and types from @shared/schema (FunctionalRestrictions, RestrictionItem, RestrictionCapability)

2. Defines RestrictionExtractionResult interface:
```typescript
interface RestrictionExtractionResult {
  restrictions: FunctionalRestrictions;
  maxWorkHoursPerDay: number | null;
  maxWorkDaysPerWeek: number | null;
  confidence: number;
}
```

3. Implements `extractFunctionalRestrictions` function that:
   - Takes input: { capacity: string, notes?: string, restrictions?: RestrictionItem[], workCapacityPercentage?: number }
   - Uses Claude Haiku (claude-3-haiku-20240307) - same model as certificateService.ts
   - Builds a structured extraction prompt that asks Claude to classify each demand category as: "can" | "with_modifications" | "cannot" | "not_assessed"
   - Extracts numeric limits: liftingMaxKg, carryingMaxKg, maxWorkHoursPerDay, maxWorkDaysPerWeek
   - Parses Claude's JSON response with error handling
   - Returns RestrictionExtractionResult with confidence score

4. Uses logger from "../lib/logger" for logging (pattern from certificateService.ts)

5. Handles edge cases:
   - Empty/null notes: return all fields as "not_assessed" with low confidence
   - "fit" capacity with no restrictions: return all fields as "can"
   - "unfit" capacity: return all physical demands as "cannot"
   - Low confidence parse: return requiresReview flag

Use the prompt structure from research:
- List all physical demands (sitting, standingWalking, bending, squatting, kneelingClimbing, twisting, reachingOverhead, reachingForward, neckMovement, lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, repetitiveMovements, useOfInjuredLimb)
- Request JSON-only response matching FunctionalRestrictions schema
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `npm run build` - TypeScript compiles without errors.
Run `npm test` - existing tests pass (new service has no tests yet).
  </verify>
  <done>
restrictionExtractor.ts exists with extractFunctionalRestrictions function that can process certificate data and return structured FunctionalRestrictions.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Run database migration for new field</name>
  <files>drizzle migrations</files>
  <action>
Generate and apply the database migration for the new functionalRestrictionsJson field:

1. Run `npm run drizzle:generate` to create migration file
2. Run `npm run db:push` to apply changes to the database

If db:push fails due to existing data, the JSONB field should accept null by default so existing rows are unaffected.
  </action>
  <verify>
`npm run db:push` completes successfully.
Query database to confirm medical_certificates table has functional_restrictions_json column.
  </verify>
  <done>
Database schema updated with functional_restrictions_json column on medical_certificates table.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` passes
2. `npm test` passes
3. shared/schema.ts has functionalRestrictionsJson field on medicalCertificates
4. server/services/restrictionExtractor.ts exports extractFunctionalRestrictions
5. Database has functional_restrictions_json column
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- FunctionalRestrictions can be stored on medical certificates
- Extraction service can parse certificate data using Claude Haiku
- All demand categories covered: sitting, standing/walking, bending, squatting, kneeling/climbing, twisting, reaching overhead, reaching forward, neck movement, lifting, carrying, pushing, pulling, repetitive movements, use of injured limb
- Time limits extracted: maxWorkHoursPerDay, maxWorkDaysPerWeek
- Weight limits extracted: liftingMaxKg, carryingMaxKg
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-medical-integration/03-01-SUMMARY.md`
