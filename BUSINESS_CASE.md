### The Victorian Opportunity

5. **Wasted Time:** Case managers spend 70% on admin, 30% on workers

### Target Customer Profile

**Primary:** Mid-market employers (50-500 employees)
- Multiple injury cases annually (5-20)
- No dedicated WorkCover specialist
- Using generic HR systems or spreadsheets
- Budget: $500-2,000/month for compliance tools

**Secondary:** HR consulting firms / return-to-work providers
